When OpenAI introduced a new capability, the internet usually explodes. GPT-5 rumors trend, new multimedia features go viral, and early demos flood social media. But sometimes the biggest shifts don't come with fanfare. They arrive quietly, almost unnoticed, as a subtle tweak to the user interface.

The recent introduction of branching in ChatGPT is a perfect example. It wasn't hyped. It didn't make headlines. But the implications go far beyond convenience.

Before branching, to pursue a new creative path, you had to start a new chat and lose the context. You could edit an earlier prompt, but that would erase the subsequent conversation. With branching changes that. Suddenly, you can:

- Create alternate drafts of an idea.
- Explore different coding solutions.
- Pursue multiple strategies in parallel.

This seemingly small feature fundamentally alters the nature of AI interaction from a linear conversation to a non-linear exploration. It's a simple change, but an important one.
